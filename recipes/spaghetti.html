    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For this spaghetti, we turn to our favorite quick meat sauce recipe. It's 
        made using one-pot, is ultra flavorful, and can be made in under 45 minutes. 
        The spaghetti sauce is also perfect for making ahead. It can be refrigerated 
        for up to three days and stored in your freezer for about three months.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground meat like beef, turkey, chicken or lamb</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup (130 grams) chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 cup water, broth or dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). 
            Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, 
            use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li><br>

        <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, 
            about 5 minutes.</li><br>

        <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, 
            stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li><br>

        <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or 
            onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon 
            of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low 
            simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes.  </li><br>
            
        <li>
            About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of 
            salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, 
            but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking 
            time.</li><br>

        <li>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the 
            cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some 
            of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on 
            top.</li><br>
    </ol>
